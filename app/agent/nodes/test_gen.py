  "returns_zero" or "returns_default" in a name when the correct behaviour is to raise an error.
- If the code should raise an exception on invalid input, the test expects that exception with
  `with pytest.raises(ValueError):` inside the function body (NEVER use `@pytest.raises` as a decorator).
  A test that expects the buggy result (like ZeroDivisionError) is wrong and must not be written.
